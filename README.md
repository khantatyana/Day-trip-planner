* The outdoors has a lower transmission risk and helps separate the newly blurred lines of work and home.
* Create a day trip planner linked to the 400+ National Parks with a user-friendly interface. 
* Allow users to locate all parks within their state. User can refine their search by filtering through themes and activities.
* Link location and local weather information to produce a seamless planning experience.
